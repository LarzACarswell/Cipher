##This program was written in Python 2.7.6.
Some things to note:<br>
1. Run cipher4.py in an IDE or from command line. I plan on making the program one entire file later.<br>
2. cipher4.py imports cipher3.py and uses its slightly more advanced Caesar cipher to encrypt a raw message.<br>
3. A sample message is declared and passed to the encryption function in cipher4.py.<br>
4. Keywords.txt is a 100 line list of plain text words that are assigned to each character in python's string.printable.
